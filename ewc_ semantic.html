            <h1>Ethiopia</h1>
            <p>Ethiopia, historically also known as Abyssinia, is Africa's 
                oldest independent country and its second largest in terms of population. 
                It served as a symbol of African independence throughout the colonial period, 
                and was a founder member of the United Nations and the African base for many 
                international organizations.Ethiopia has as many as 80 ethnic groups, each with its own language. </p><br>
            <p>
                Ethiopia is a federal state subdivided into ethno-linguistically based regional states (plural: kililoch; 
                singular: kilil) and chartered cities (plural: astedader akababiwach; singular: astedader akabibi). This 
                system of administrative regions replaced the provinces of Ethiopia in 1992 under the Transitional Government 
                of Ethiopia and was formalised in 1995 when the current Constitution of Ethiopia came into force.

              The regions are each governed by a regional council whose members are directly elected to represent districts (woreda). 
             Each council has a president, who is elected by the council. The regions also have an executive committee, whose members
         are selected by the president from among the councilors and approved by the council. Each region has a sector bureau, which
            implements the council mandate and reports to the executive committee
